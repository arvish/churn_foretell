    - IF AND ONLY IF THE CUSTOMER HAS LESS THAN 40% risk of churning, ONLY THEN generate a 3 sentence explaination of why they might not be at risk of churning.
    - Your explaination should be based on the customer's information, the summary statistics of churned and non-churned customers, and the feature importances provided.
